This project is an IoT-enabled health monitoring system designed to measure and track patient pulse rate and body temperature in real time. Using sensors for pulse and temperature, the system captures vital health data and transmits it to a remote server or cloud platform for easy monitoring and analysis. Ideal for remote patient care, this solution provides continuous updates, timely alerts, and can be easily integrated with other healthcare systems for improved patient management.
